  title     = "Representation and agenda setting",
  author    = "Jones, B D and Baumgartner, F R",
  abstract  = "We develop a new approach to the study of representation based
               on agenda setting and attention allocation. We ask the
               fundamental question: do the policy priorities of the public and
               of the government correspond across time? To assess the policy
               priorities of the mass public, we have coded the Most Important
               Problem data from Gallup polls across the postwar period into
               the policy content categories developed by the Policy Agendas
               Project (Baumgartner and Jones, 2002). Congressional priorities
               were assessed by the proportion of total hearings in a given
               year focusing on those same policy categories, also from the
               Agendas Project. We then conducted similar analyses on public
               laws and most important laws, similarly coded. Finally we
               analyzed the spatial structure of public and congressional
               agendas using the Shepard-Kruskal non-metric multidimensional
               scaling algorithm. Findings may be summarized as follows: First,
               there is an impressive congruence between the priorities of the
               public and the priorities of Congress across time. Second, there
               is substantial evidence of congruence between the priorities of
               the public and lawmaking in the national government, but the
               correspondence is attenuated in comparison to agendas. Third,
               although the priorities of the public and Congress are
               structurally similar, the location of issues within the
               structure differs between Congress and the general public. The
               public ``lumps'' its evaluation of the nations most important
               problems into a small number of categories. Congress ``splits''
               issues out, handling multiple issues simultaneously. Finally,
               the public tends to focus on a very constrained set of issues,
               but Congress juggles many more issues. The article has strong
               implications for the study of positional representation as well,
               because for traditional representation to occur, there must be
               correspondence between the issue-priorities of the public and
               the government. We find substantial evidence for such attention
               congruence here. \copyright{} 2004 The Policy Studies Journal

               issues, from the economy and education to health care and
               defense. This has been true for years, but until now no studies
               have been conducted on how politicians manage the flood of
               information from a wide range of sources. How do they interpret
               and respond to such inundation? Which issues do they pay
               attention to and why? Bryan D. Jones and Frank R. Baumgartner
               answer these questions on decision-making processes and
               prioritization in The Politics of Attention. Analyzing fifty
               years of data, Jones and Baumgartner's book is the first study
               of American politics based on a new information-processing
               perspective. The authors bring together the allocation of
               attention and the operation of governing institutions into a
               single model that traces public policies, public and media
               attention to them, and governmental decisions across multiple
               institutions. The Politics of Attention offers a groundbreaking
               approach to American politics based on the responses of
               policymakers to the flow of information. It asks how the system
               solves, or fails to solve, problems rather than looking to how
               individual preferences are realized through political action.",

               Scott Adler and John Lapinski is the first to assess our
               political institutions by looking at what the authors refer to
               as legislative accomplishment. The book moves beyond current
               research on Congress that focuses primarily on rules, internal
               structure, and the microbehavior of individual lawmakers, to
               look at the mechanisms that govern how policy is enacted and
               implemented in the United States. It includes essays on topics
               ranging from those dealing with the microfoundations of
               congressional output, to large N empirical analyses that assess
               current theories of lawmaking, to policy-centered case studies.
               All of the chapters take a Congress-centered perspective on
               macropolicy while still appreciating the importance of other
               branches of government in explaining policy accomplishment. The
               Macropolitics of Congress shines light on promising pathways for
               the exploration of such key issues as the nature of political
               representation. It will make a significant contribution to the
               study of Congress and, more generally, to our understanding of

               their collective problem-solving abilities - can produce novel
               insights into legislative organization, behavior, and output.
               How do issues end up on the agenda? Why do lawmakers routinely
               invest in program oversight and broad policy development? What
               considerations drive legislative policy change? Knowing that
               their prospects for reelection are partly dependent on their
               collective problem-solving abilities, lawmakers support
               structures that enhance the legislature's capacity to address
               problems in society and encourage members to contribute to
               nonparticularistic policy-making activities. The resulting
               insights are novel and substantial: Congress' collective
               performance affects the reelection prospects of incumbents of
               both parties; the legislative issue agenda can often be
               predicted years in advance; nearly all important successful
               legislation originates in committee; most laws pass with
               bipartisan support; and electorally induced shifts in
               preferences or partisan control are not robust predictors of
               policy change. The electoral imperative to address problems in
               society provides a compelling explanation for these important
               and provocative findings.",

               candidate-centered elections of the present? In this landmark
               book, John Aldrich goes beyond the clamor of arguments over
               whether American political parties are in resurgence or decline
               and undertakes a wholesale reexamination of the foundations of
               the American party system. Surveying three critical episodes in
               the development of American political parties---from their
               formation in the 1790s to the Civil War---Aldrich shows how
               parties serve to combat three fundamental problems of democracy:
               how to regulate the number of people seeking public office; how
               to mobilize voters; and how to achieve and maintain the
               majorities needed to accomplish goals once in office. Overcoming
               these obstacles, argues Aldrich, is possible only with political
               parties. Aldrich brings this innovative account up to date by
               looking at the profound changes in the character of political
               parties since World War II. In the 1960s, he shows, parties
               started to become candidate-centered organizations that are
               servants to their office seekers and officeholders. Aldrich
               argues that this development has revitalized parties, making
               them stronger, and more vital, with well-defined cleavages and
               highly effective governing ability.",

               that the capacity of the minority party to exert legislative

               majority party, which create opportunities for the minority

               sufficient motivation for the minority to engage in legislating
               rather than electioneering. Drawing on data on every bill

               and case examples of notable lawmaking efforts during the same

               consider a small proportion of bills, only detail how often
               negative agenda power fails (rather than succeeds), and cannot

               incentives and strategies of agenda decision-making, then, we
               must know about members' preferences on all bills. I develop an
               approach to estimate members' preferences on all bills, by
               generating quantitative characterizations of the policy content

               And what are the consequences of that process? Like individuals,
               Congress is subject to the ``paradox of search.'' If policy
               makers don't look for problems, they won't find those that need
               to be addressed. But if they carry out a thorough search, they
               will almost certainly find new problems---and with the
               definition of each new problem comes the possibility of creating
               a government program to address it. With The Politics of
               Attention, leading policy scholars Frank R. Baumgartner and
               Bryan D. Jones demonstrated the central role attention plays in
               how governments prioritize problems. Now, with The Politics of

               process itself, showing how the growth or contraction of
               government is closely related to how it searches for information
               and how, as an organization, it analyzes its findings. Better
               search processes that incorporate more diverse viewpoints lead
               to more intensive policymaking activity. Similarly, limiting
               search processes leads to declines in policy making. At the same

               control, changes in presidential leadership, and shifts in
               public opinion---can be systematically related to the patterns

               scholars who alternately challenge or confirm the work on

               explaining the dynamics of gridlock. To test the model, I
               construct a measure that assesses legislative output in

               filibuster? Is the filibuster an important right that improves
               the political process or an increasingly partisan tool that
               delays legislation and thwarts the will of the majority? Are
               century-old procedures in the Senate hampering the institution
               from fulfilling its role on the eve of the 21st century?The
               filibuster has achieved almost mythic proportions in the history
               of American politics, but it has escaped a careful, critical
               assessment for more than 50 years. In this book, Sarah Binder
               and Steven Smith provide such an assessment as they address the
               problems and conventional wisdom associated with the Senate's
               long-standing tradition of extended debate.The authors examine
               the evolution of the rules governing Senate debate, analyze the
               consequences of these rules, and evaluate reform proposals. They
               argue that in an era of unprecedented filibustering and related
               obstructionism, old habits are indeed undermining the Senate's
               ability to meet its responsibilities. Binder and Smith
               scrutinize conventional wisdom about the filibuster---and show
               that very little of it is true. They focus on five major myths:
               that unlimited debate is a fundamental right to differentiate
               the Senate from the House of Representatives; that the Senate's
               tradition as a deliberative body requires unlimited debate; that
               the filibuster is reserved for a few issues of the utmost
               national importance; that few measures are actually killed by
               the filibuster; and that senators resist changing the rules
               because of a principled commitment to deliberation. In revising
               conventional wisdom about the filibuster, Binder and Smith
               contribute to ongoing debates about the dynamics of
               institutional change in the American political system. The
               authors conclude by suggesting reforms intended to enhance the
               power of determined majorities while preserving the rights of
               chamber minorities. They advocate, for example, lowering the
               number of votes required to end debate while increasing the
               amount of time for senators to debate controversial bills.
               Reform is possible, they suggest, that is consistent with the
               Senate's unique size and responsibilities.",

  author    = "Binder, Sarah A",
  abstract  = "Gridlock is not a modern legislative condition. Although the
               term is said to have entered the American political lexicon
               after the 1980 elections, Alexander Hamilton complained about it
               more than two hundred years ago. In many ways, stalemate seems
               endemic to American politics. Constitutional skeptics even
               suggest that the framers intentionally designed the Constitution
               to guarantee gridlock. In Stalemate, Sarah Binder examines the
               causes and consequences of gridlock, focusing on the ability of
               Congress to broach and secure policy compromise on significant
               national issues. Reviewing more than fifty years of legislative
               history, Binder measures the frequency of deadlock during that
               time and offers concrete advice for policymakers interested in
               improving the institutional capacity of Congress. Binder begins
               by revisiting the notion of ``framers' intent,'' investigating
               whether gridlock was the preferred outcome of those who designed
               the American system of separated powers. Her research suggests
               that frequent policy gridlock might instead be an unintended
               consequence of constitutional design. Next, she explores the
               ways in which elections and institutions together shape the
               capacity of Congress and the president to make public law. She
               examines two facets of its institutional evolution: the
               emergence of the Senate as a coequal legislative partner of the
               House and the insertion of political parties into a legislative
               arena originally devoid of parties. Finally, she offers a new
               empirical approach for testing accounts of policy stalemate
               during the decades since World War II. These measurements reveal
               patterns in legislative performance during the second half of
               the twentieth century, showing the frequency of policy deadlock
               and the legislative stages at which it has most often emerged in
               the postwar period. Binder uses the new measure of stalemate to
               explain empirical patterns in the frequency of gridlock. The
               results weave together the effects of institutions and elections
               and place in perspective the impact of divided government on
               legislative performance. The conclusion addresses the
               consequences of legislative stalemate, assessing whether and to
               what degree deadlock might affect electoral fortunes, political
               ambitions, and institutional reputations of legislators and
               presidents. The results suggest that recurring episodes of
               stalemate pose a dilemma for legislators and others who care
               about the institutional standing and capacity of Congress.
               Binder encourages scholars, political observers, and lawmakers
               to consider modest reforms that could have strong and salutary
               effects on the institutional standing and legitimacy of Congress
               and the president.",

               calamities that cause both citizens and policymakers to pay more

               This book, the first comprehensive analysis of these dramatic
               events, explains how and why some public disasters change
               political agendas and, ultimately, public policies. Thomas A.
               Birkland explores important successes and failures in the policy
               process by analyzing the political outcomes of four types of
               events: earthquakes, hurricanes, oil spills, and nuclear
               accidents. Using this empirical data to go beyond an intuitive
               understanding of focusing events, he presents a theory of where
               and when these events will gain attention and how they trigger
               political reactions. Birkland concludes that different types of
               disasters result in different kinds of agenda politics. Public
               outrage over the highly visible damage caused by the Exxon
               Valdez oil spill, for example, ended a fourteen-year logjam
               holding back Congressional legislation to regulate oil spill
               cleanups. On the other hand, the intangible effects of Three
               Mile Island had less concrete results in a political arena that
               was already highly polarized. Integrating a variety of theories
               on the policy process, including agenda setting, policy
               communities, advocacy coalitions, the political aspects of the
               news media, and the use of symbols in political debate, Birkland
               illuminates the dynamics of event-driven policy activity. As the
               first extensive study of its kind, this book offers new insights

               officials act on a policy issue, but how policy issues make the
               news in the first place has remained a puzzle. Why do some
               issues go viral and then just as quickly fall off the radar? How
               is it that the media can sustain public interest for months in a
               complex story like negotiations over Obamacare while ignoring
               other important issues in favor of stories on ``balloon boy?''
               With Making the News, Amber Boydstun offers an eye-opening look
               at the explosive patterns of media attention that determine
               which issues are brought before the public. At the heart of her
               argument is the observation that the media have two modes: an
               ``alarm mode'' for breaking stories and a ``patrol mode'' for
               covering them in greater depth. While institutional incentives
               often initiate alarm mode around a story, they also propel news
               outlets into the watchdog-like patrol mode around its policy
               implications until the next big news item breaks. What results
               from this pattern of fixation followed by rapid change is skewed
               coverage of policy issues, with a few receiving the majority of
               media attention while others receive none at all. Boydstun
               documents this systemic explosiveness and skew through analysis
               of media coverage across policy issues, including in-depth looks
               at the waxing and waning of coverage around two issues: capital
               punishment and the ``war on terror.'' Making the News shows how
               the seemingly unpredictable day-to-day decisions of the newsroom
               produce distinct patterns of operation with implications---good
               and bad---for national politics.",

               strategic agenda-setting choices made by that party. Do majority

               benefits associated with floor consideration of partisan
               legislation. We test hypotheses derived from our theory on a

               the 104th--114th Congresses (1995--2016). We find that minority
               party opposition in committee is associated with a decreased

               legislatures, composed of members from two sharply disagreeing
               parties, are struggling to function as the founders intended
               them to. If we want to reduce the ideological gulf in our
               legislatures, we must first understand what has caused it to
               widen so much over the past forty years. Andrew B. Hall argues
               that we have missed one of the most important reasons for this
               ideological gulf: the increasing reluctance of moderate citizens
               to run for office. While political scientists, journalists, and
               pundits have largely focused on voters, worried that they may be
               too partisan, too uninformed to vote for moderate candidates, or
               simply too extreme in their own political views, Hall argues
               that our political system discourages moderate candidates from
               seeking office in the first place. Running for office has rarely
               been harder than it is in America today, and the costs dissuade
               moderates more than extremists. Candidates have to wage
               ceaseless campaigns, dialing for dollars for most of their
               waking hours while enduring relentless news and social media
               coverage. When moderate candidates are unwilling to run, voters
               do not even have the opportunity to send them to office. To
               understand what is wrong with our legislatures, then, we need to

               House, 1980--2010, using a regression discontinuity design in
               primary elections. When an extremist---as measured by
               primary-election campaign receipt patterns---wins a
               ``coin-flip'' election over a more moderate candidate, the
               party's general-election vote share decreases on average by
               approximately 9--13 percentage points, and the probability that
               the party wins the seat decreases by 35--54 percentage points.
               This electoral penalty is so large that nominating the more
               extreme primary candidate causes the district's subsequent
               roll-call representation to reverse, on average, becoming more
               liberal when an extreme Republican is nominated and more
               conservative when an extreme Democrat is nominated. Overall, the

               by pooling enactments instead of disaggregating laws by policy

               studying the direct impact that the politics surrounding a
               particular issue has on lawmaking. The Substance of

               data to better understand how lawmaking works across different
               policy areas. Specifically, John Lapinski introduces a
               theoretically grounded method for parsing policy issues into
               categories, and he shows how policymaking varies in predictable
               ways based on the specific issue area being addressed. Lapinski
               examines the ways in which key factors that influence
               policymaking matter for certain types of policy issues, and he
               includes an exhaustive look at how elite political polarization
               shifts across these areas. He considers how Congress behaves
               according to the policy issue at hand, and how particular
               areas--such as war, sovereignty issues, and immigration
               reform--change legislative performance. Relying on records of

               members of Congress. Recent efforts have extended the debate to
               the more specific question of whether or not party influences
               are sufficiently strong to move policy outcomes away from the
               median position. In this article, we specify four theories of

               theory of behavior. This theory posits that there are no party

               yield distinctive predictions about the legislators who will
               support bills on final passage votes. After testing, our
               conclusion is that strong party influences can be found in final
               passage voting in the House: the partyless theory receives
               little support, but a model based on majority party agenda

               policy dimensions in American politics?a process that we term
               conflict extension. We discuss various perspectives on increases

               in the electorate, and the parties' activists, and we consider
               the causal links between polarization at each of these levels.

               ignored in the most prominent theories of legislative decision
               making. In this paper, we fill this gap by developing a
               theoretical treatment of agenda setting at the amendment stage.
               Specifically, our theoretical approach defines the relationship
               between agenda setting at the amendment stage and outcomes at
               final passage. We test several implications using data from the
               US House of Representatives, and show that amendments do
               mitigate some of the majority party's agenda setting advantage
               by moderating initial proposals away from the majority party
               position. However, amendments do not systematically undermine
               the majority party's negative agenda control, as we find that

               American history. In Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the New American
               Politics, Ron Peters, one of America's leading scholars of
               Congress, and Cindy Simon Rosenthal, one of America's leading
               scholars on women and political leadership, provide a
               comprehensive account of how Pelosi became speaker and what this
               tells us about Congress in the twenty-first century. They
               consider the key issues that Pelosi's rise presents for American
               politics, highlight the core themes that have shaped, and
               continue to shape, her remarkable caree, and discuss the
               challenges that women face in the male-dominated world of
               American politics, particularly at its highest levels. The
               authors also shed light on Pelosi's political background: first
               as the scion of a powerful Baltimore political family whose
               power base lay in East Coast urban ethnic politics, and later as
               a successful politician in what is probably the most liberal
               city in the country, San Francisco. Peters and Rosenthal trace
               how she built her base within the House Democratic Caucus and
               ultimately consolidated enough power to win the Speakership.
               They show how twelve years out of power allowed her to fashion a
               new image for House Democrats, and they conclude with an
               analysis of her institutional leadership style. The only
               full-length portrait of Nancy Pelosi in print, this superb

               potentially useful tool for evaluating arguments that the
               majority party in the House exercises influence by controlling
               what does and does not make it onto the agenda. Despite its
               promise, so far the use of roll rates to test these arguments
               has faced the problem of observational equivalence-that the

               Congress in what Barbara Sinclair has dubbed ``unorthodox
               lawmaking.'' In this much-anticipated Fifth Edition of
               Unorthodox Lawmaking, Sinclair explores the full range of
               special procedures and processes that make up Congress's work,
               as well as the reasons these unconventional routes evolved. The
               author introduces students to the intricacies of Congress and
               provides the tools to assess the relative successes and
               limitations of the institution. This dramatically updated
               revision incorporates a wealth of new cases and examples to
               illustrate the changes occurring in congressional process. Two
               entirely new case study chapters---on the 2013 government
               shutdown and the 2015 reauthorization of the Patriot
               Act---highlight Sinclair's fresh analysis and the book is now
               introduced by a new foreword from noted scholar and teacher,
               Bruce I. Oppenheimer, reflecting on this book and Barbara
               Sinclair's significant mark on the study of Congress.",

               ideal point uncertainty",
  author    = "Stiglitz, Edward H and Weingast, Barry R",
  abstract  = "This article develops two new tests of partisan and nonpartisan
               theories of lawmaking based on cutpoint estimates and measures
               of uncertainty about ideal point estimates. Theories of
               congressional organization make explicit predictions about the
               absence of cutpoints in certain intervals of the policy space.
               We test these theories with new cutpoint estimates and exploit
               the fact that the ideal points of members located far from the
               density of cutpoints are necessarily estimated with less
               precision. We validate our empirical approach through
               simulations, and we test three models of congressional
               organization using House roll call data from the 86th through
               the 110th Congresses (1959?2008). We find strong evidence of
               partisan agenda control. Our findings exhibit modest differences
               from the results predicted by Cox and McCubbins's party cartel
               theory: negative agenda control increases over time and is
               negatively correlated with the size of the blockout region.",

@ARTICLE{Thorson1998-vs,

               1947-1990",
  author    = "Thorson, Gregory R",
  abstract  = "Recent literature has provided some evidence that the presence
               of di vided government does not affect the amount of significant
               legislation passed by Congress and enacted into law (Mayhew
               1991). In this article, I argue that although there may not be a
               difference in the absolute num ber of bills passed during
               unified and divided periods, there nevertheless may be an
               important difference in the formation of coalitions1 during
               divided and unified periods. Specifically, I argue that party
               unity votes that favor the dominant party 2 are more likely to
               form on final votes of passage during periods of unified
               government. I use regression analysis and probit analysis to
               determine if there is empirical support for this hypothesized
               difference in coalition formation. I find that the presence of
               unified government significantly increases the likelihood that a
               bill will pass through Congress with a party unity vote favoring
               the dominant party The estimates are statistically significant
               for both the House and the Senate.",

  author    = "Zahariadis, Nikolaos",
  abstract  = "Zahariadis offers a theory that explains policymaking when
               ``ambiguity'' is present---a state in which there are many ways,
               often irreconcilable, of thinking about an issue. Expanding and
               extending John Kingdon's influential ``multiple streams'' model
               that explains agenda setting, Zahariadis argues that
               manipulation, the bending of ideas, process, and beliefs to get
               what you want out of the policy process, is the key to
               understanding the dynamics of policymaking in conditions of
               ambiguity. He takes one of the major theories of public policy
               to the next step in three different ways: he extends it to a
               different form of government (parliamentary democracies, where
               Kingdon looked only at what he called the United States's
               presidential ``organized anarchy'' form of government); he
               examines the entire policy formation process, not just agenda
               setting; and he applies it to foreign as well as domestic
               policy.This book combines theory with cases to illuminate
               policymaking in a variety of modern democracies. The cases cover
               economic policymaking in Britain, France, and Germany, foreign
               policymaking in Greece, all compared to the U.S. (where the
               model was first developed), and an innovative computer
               simulation of the policy process.",
