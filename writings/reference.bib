  title     = "Representation and agenda setting",
  author    = "Jones, B D and Baumgartner, F R",
  abstract  = "We develop a new approach to the study of representation based
               on agenda setting and attention allocation. We ask the
               fundamental question: do the policy priorities of the public and
               of the government correspond across time? To assess the policy
               priorities of the mass public, we have coded the Most Important
               Problem data from Gallup polls across the postwar period into
               the policy content categories developed by the Policy Agendas
               Project (Baumgartner and Jones, 2002). Congressional priorities
               were assessed by the proportion of total hearings in a given
               year focusing on those same policy categories, also from the
               Agendas Project. We then conducted similar analyses on public
               laws and most important laws, similarly coded. Finally we
               analyzed the spatial structure of public and congressional
               agendas using the Shepard-Kruskal non-metric multidimensional
               scaling algorithm. Findings may be summarized as follows: First,
               there is an impressive congruence between the priorities of the
               public and the priorities of Congress across time. Second, there
               is substantial evidence of congruence between the priorities of
               the public and lawmaking in the national government, but the
               correspondence is attenuated in comparison to agendas. Third,
               although the priorities of the public and Congress are
               structurally similar, the location of issues within the
               structure differs between Congress and the general public. The
               public ``lumps'' its evaluation of the nations most important
               problems into a small number of categories. Congress ``splits''
               issues out, handling multiple issues simultaneously. Finally,
               the public tends to focus on a very constrained set of issues,
               but Congress juggles many more issues. The article has strong
               implications for the study of positional representation as well,
               because for traditional representation to occur, there must be
               correspondence between the issue-priorities of the public and
               the government. We find substantial evidence for such attention
               congruence here. \copyright{} 2004 The Policy Studies Journal

  abstract  = "How does the government decide what's a problem and what isn't?
               And what are the consequences of that process? Like individuals,
               Congress is subject to the ``paradox of search.'' If policy
               makers don't look for problems, they won't find those that need
               to be addressed. But if they carry out a thorough search, they
               will almost certainly find new problems---and with the
               definition of each new problem comes the possibility of creating
               a government program to address it. With The Politics of
               Attention, leading policy scholars Frank R. Baumgartner and
               Bryan D. Jones demonstrated the central role attention plays in
               how governments prioritize problems. Now, with The Politics of
               Information, they turn the focus to the problem-detection
               process itself, showing how the growth or contraction of
               government is closely related to how it searches for information
               and how, as an organization, it analyzes its findings. Better
               search processes that incorporate more diverse viewpoints lead
               to more intensive policymaking activity. Similarly, limiting
               search processes leads to declines in policy making. At the same
               time, the authors find little evidence that the factors usually
               thought to be responsible for government expansion---partisan
               control, changes in presidential leadership, and shifts in
               public opinion---can be systematically related to the patterns
               they observe. Drawing on data tracing the course of American
               public policy since World War II, Baumgartner and Jones once
               again deepen our understanding of the dynamics of American
               policy making.",

               fifteen years ago, offering a profoundly original account of how
               policy issues rise and fall on the national agenda, the Journal
               of Politics predicted that it would ``become a landmark study of
               public policy making and American politics.'' That prediction
               proved true and, in this long-awaited second edition, Bryan
               Jones and Frank Baumgartner refine their influential argument
               and expand it to illuminate the workings of democracies beyond
               the United States. The authors retain all the substance of their
               contention that short-term, single-issue analyses cast public
               policy too narrowly as the result of cozy and dependable
               arrangements among politicians, interest groups, and the media.
               Jones and Baumgartner provide a different interpretation by
               taking the long view of several issues---including nuclear
               energy, urban affairs, smoking, and auto safety---to demonstrate
               that bursts of rapid, unpredictable policy change punctuate the
               patterns of stability more frequently associated with
               government. Featuring a new introduction and two additional
               chapters, this updated edition ensures that their findings will
               remain a touchstone of policy studies for many years to come.",

               investment -- how democratic governments seek to enhance their

               priorities for the public, analogous to the relationship between
               investment manager and client. Governments choose policies that

               Events",
  author    = "Birkland, Thomas A",
  abstract  = "Disasters like earthquakes are known as focusing events--sudden
               calamities that cause both citizens and policymakers to pay more
               attention to a public problem and often to press for solutions.
               This book, the first comprehensive analysis of these dramatic
               events, explains how and why some public disasters change
               political agendas and, ultimately, public policies. Thomas A.
               Birkland explores important successes and failures in the policy
               process by analyzing the political outcomes of four types of
               events: earthquakes, hurricanes, oil spills, and nuclear
               accidents. Using this empirical data to go beyond an intuitive
               understanding of focusing events, he presents a theory of where
               and when these events will gain attention and how they trigger
               political reactions. Birkland concludes that different types of
               disasters result in different kinds of agenda politics. Public
               outrage over the highly visible damage caused by the Exxon
               Valdez oil spill, for example, ended a fourteen-year logjam
               holding back Congressional legislation to regulate oil spill
               cleanups. On the other hand, the intangible effects of Three
               Mile Island had less concrete results in a political arena that
               was already highly polarized. Integrating a variety of theories
               on the policy process, including agenda setting, policy
               communities, advocacy coalitions, the political aspects of the
               news media, and the use of symbols in political debate, Birkland
               illuminates the dynamics of event-driven policy activity. As the
               first extensive study of its kind, this book offers new insights
               into the policy process.",

               influence of focusing events, but few policy studies
               systematically examine the dynamics of these events. This
               article closes this gap by examining focusing events, group
               mobilization and agenda-setting. Using natural disasters and
               industrial accidents as examples, most focusing events change
               the dominant issues on the agenda in a policy domain, they can
               lead to interest group mobilization, and groups often actively
               seek to expand or contain issues after a focusing event. I
               explain how differences in the composition of policy communities
               and the nature of the events themselves influence group and
               agenda dynamics. The organization of policy communities is an
               important factor in agenda setting, but agenda setting and group
