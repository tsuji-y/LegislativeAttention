  title     = "Representation and agenda setting",
  author    = "Jones, B D and Baumgartner, F R",
  abstract  = "We develop a new approach to the study of representation based
               on agenda setting and attention allocation. We ask the
               fundamental question: do the policy priorities of the public and
               of the government correspond across time? To assess the policy
               priorities of the mass public, we have coded the Most Important
               Problem data from Gallup polls across the postwar period into
               the policy content categories developed by the Policy Agendas
               Project (Baumgartner and Jones, 2002). Congressional priorities
               were assessed by the proportion of total hearings in a given
               year focusing on those same policy categories, also from the
               Agendas Project. We then conducted similar analyses on public
               laws and most important laws, similarly coded. Finally we
               analyzed the spatial structure of public and congressional
               agendas using the Shepard-Kruskal non-metric multidimensional
               scaling algorithm. Findings may be summarized as follows: First,
               there is an impressive congruence between the priorities of the
               public and the priorities of Congress across time. Second, there
               is substantial evidence of congruence between the priorities of
               the public and lawmaking in the national government, but the
               correspondence is attenuated in comparison to agendas. Third,
               although the priorities of the public and Congress are
               structurally similar, the location of issues within the
               structure differs between Congress and the general public. The
               public ``lumps'' its evaluation of the nations most important
               problems into a small number of categories. Congress ``splits''
               issues out, handling multiple issues simultaneously. Finally,
               the public tends to focus on a very constrained set of issues,
               but Congress juggles many more issues. The article has strong
               implications for the study of positional representation as well,
               because for traditional representation to occur, there must be
               correspondence between the issue-priorities of the public and
               the government. We find substantial evidence for such attention
               congruence here. \copyright{} 2004 The Policy Studies Journal

               candidate-centered elections of the present? In this landmark
               book, John Aldrich goes beyond the clamor of arguments over
               whether American political parties are in resurgence or decline
               and undertakes a wholesale reexamination of the foundations of
               the American party system. Surveying three critical episodes in
               the development of American political parties---from their
               formation in the 1790s to the Civil War---Aldrich shows how
               parties serve to combat three fundamental problems of democracy:
               how to regulate the number of people seeking public office; how
               to mobilize voters; and how to achieve and maintain the
               majorities needed to accomplish goals once in office. Overcoming
               these obstacles, argues Aldrich, is possible only with political
               parties. Aldrich brings this innovative account up to date by
               looking at the profound changes in the character of political
               parties since World War II. In the 1960s, he shows, parties
               started to become candidate-centered organizations that are
               servants to their office seekers and officeholders. Aldrich
               argues that this development has revitalized parties, making
               them stronger, and more vital, with well-defined cleavages and
               highly effective governing ability.",

               And what are the consequences of that process? Like individuals,
               Congress is subject to the ``paradox of search.'' If policy
               makers don't look for problems, they won't find those that need
               to be addressed. But if they carry out a thorough search, they
               will almost certainly find new problems---and with the
               definition of each new problem comes the possibility of creating
               a government program to address it. With The Politics of
               Attention, leading policy scholars Frank R. Baumgartner and
               Bryan D. Jones demonstrated the central role attention plays in
               how governments prioritize problems. Now, with The Politics of
               Information, they turn the focus to the problem-detection
               process itself, showing how the growth or contraction of
               government is closely related to how it searches for information
               and how, as an organization, it analyzes its findings. Better
               search processes that incorporate more diverse viewpoints lead
               to more intensive policymaking activity. Similarly, limiting
               search processes leads to declines in policy making. At the same

               This book, the first comprehensive analysis of these dramatic
               events, explains how and why some public disasters change
               political agendas and, ultimately, public policies. Thomas A.
               Birkland explores important successes and failures in the policy
               process by analyzing the political outcomes of four types of
               events: earthquakes, hurricanes, oil spills, and nuclear
               accidents. Using this empirical data to go beyond an intuitive
               understanding of focusing events, he presents a theory of where
               and when these events will gain attention and how they trigger
               political reactions. Birkland concludes that different types of
               disasters result in different kinds of agenda politics. Public
               outrage over the highly visible damage caused by the Exxon
               Valdez oil spill, for example, ended a fourteen-year logjam
               holding back Congressional legislation to regulate oil spill
               cleanups. On the other hand, the intangible effects of Three
               Mile Island had less concrete results in a political arena that
               was already highly polarized. Integrating a variety of theories
               on the policy process, including agenda setting, policy
               communities, advocacy coalitions, the political aspects of the
               news media, and the use of symbols in political debate, Birkland
               illuminates the dynamics of event-driven policy activity. As the

               set the legislative voting calendar influences policy change in
               American state legislatures. By generating an opportunity for
               party leaders to exercise gatekeeping or negative agenda
               control, such rules introduce an additional partisan veto player
               into a system of governance. This addition typically increases
               the size of the core or gridlock interval, which drives policy
               change downward. Using both traditional data on bill passage
               counts and new data on Affordable Care Act compliance, I find
               strong support for these claims. More specifically, when I
               calculate core sizes that are sensitive to agenda rules, I find
               that agenda-control-adjusted core size is negatively correlated
               with policy change, as expected. Moreover, even when I match
               states on their overall preference dispersion or polarization,
               the ability of party leaders to exercise negative agenda control
               is strongly negatively associated with policy change.

               First, what does the representative see when he or she sees a
               constituency? Second, what consequences do these perceptions
               have for his or her behavior? The paper reverses the normal
               Washington-oriented view of representative-constituent relations
               and approaches both questions by examining the representative in
               his or her constituency. The paper's observations are drawn from
               the author's travels with seventeen U.S. House members while
               they were working in their districts. Member perceptions of
               their constituency are divided into the geographical, the
               reelection, the primary and the personal constituencies.

               empirical prediction - that the size of the gridlock interval is
               negatively related to legislative productivity - has not found
               strong empirical support. We argue that previous research
               featured a disconnect between the exclusively ideological theory
               and tests that relied on outcome variables that were not purely
               ideological. We remedy this by dividing landmark laws (Mayhew)
               into two counts - those that invoke ideological preferences and
               those that do not - and uncover results consistent with Pivotal
               Politics' core prediction: the size of the gridlock interval is
               negatively related to the production of ideological legislation.
               We also find that the size of the gridlock zone is positively
               related to the production of nonideological legislation. These
               results hold up in the face of various sensitivity analyses and

               Congress, and Cindy Simon Rosenthal, one of America's leading

               comprehensive account of how Pelosi became speaker and what this
               tells us about Congress in the twenty-first century. They
               consider the key issues that Pelosi's rise presents for American
               politics, highlight the core themes that have shaped, and
               continue to shape, her remarkable caree, and discuss the
               challenges that women face in the male-dominated world of
               American politics, particularly at its highest levels. The
               authors also shed light on Pelosi's political background: first
               as the scion of a powerful Baltimore political family whose
               power base lay in East Coast urban ethnic politics, and later as
               a successful politician in what is probably the most liberal
               city in the country, San Francisco. Peters and Rosenthal trace
               how she built her base within the House Democratic Caucus and
               ultimately consolidated enough power to win the Speakership.
               They show how twelve years out of power allowed her to fashion a
               new image for House Democrats, and they conclude with an
               analysis of her institutional leadership style. The only

  author    = "Richman, J",
  abstract  = "This study demonstrates that unconditional blocking of bills
               opposed by a majority of the majority party-as implied by the
               party cartel model and advocated by former Speaker Dennis
               Hastert-can produce conditions in which the majority party loses
               popular support and loses elections. The theoretical analysis
               and empirical results imply that the use of negative agenda
               power to block bills is circumscribed by this risk of electoral
               defeat. As a result, the opportunity for effective negative
               agenda control is conditional on majority party issue advantage,
               party polarization, and the distribution of status quo
               locations. In particular, majority party roll rates should
               sometimes be nonzero, blocking increases the odds of majority
               party defeat in House of Representatives elections, and policy
               change is most likely on issues with status quo that the model
               suggests are the riskiest to block. \copyright{} 2015 Southern

               Unorthodox Lawmaking, Sinclair explores the full range of
               special procedures and processes that make up Congress's work,

               provides the tools to assess the relative successes and
               limitations of the institution. This dramatically updated
               revision incorporates a wealth of new cases and examples to
               illustrate the changes occurring in congressional process. Two
               entirely new case study chapters---on the 2013 government
               shutdown and the 2015 reauthorization of the Patriot
               Act---highlight Sinclair's fresh analysis and the book is now
